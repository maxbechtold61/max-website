My name is Maximilian Bechtold. I'm a technical writer by day, but I moonlight as a quack philosopher, computer scientist, and mathematician. I grew up in St. Louis Park (a small suburb in Minnesota), and I currently live in Minneapolis, MN. 

## My career

I've worked as a technical writer at Splunk, Inc. since July 2023. If you aren't familiar with the profession, a technical writer is essentially someone who writes instructions and tutorials (think about the people who wrote your IKEA guide). 

I primarily work on our documentation for the [OpenTelemetry Collector](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/), but I also write docs for our dashboards and detectors, as well as our API. 

### The earlier days

Before I became a technical writer, I worked as a writing consultant (a tutor) at the [University of Minnesota Center for Writing](http://writing.umn.edu/) for two years. In this role, I helped students write all kinds of things, from resumes and cover letters to lab reports and dissertations.

I also worked as a barista throughout my first two years of college. I can make a mean

## Education

I studied for my undergrad degree at the University of Minnesota, where I earned a B.A. in Philosophy and a minor in Computer Science. I sometimes refer to this minor as an "almost degree" in computer science. 

My academic interests include:

* Logic and philosophy of math
* Epistemology
* Foundations of mathematics
* Speech and rhetoric
* Writing consultancy and writing education

I graduated class of 2023 with high distinction, which is the _summa cum laude_ for students who didn't do honors. 

## Hobbies and interests

In my free time, I enjoy playing Dungeons and Dragons and similar TTRPGs. I also play a lot of video games -- my favorite series is Dark Souls. 

When I'm not playing games of some sort, I like studying random topics in math, computer science, philosophy, and science. Currently, I'm making my way through a real analysis book, and I don't think I'll finish it anytime soon.

I also like watching basketball, football, and occasionally soccer. Cheering for the Minnesota Vikings tends to make me miserable, so I often need to take breaks from sports.
