Here is where I keep some of my most important work, both professional and academic.

## Professional work

During my tenure at Splunk, I've written docs for many of our product areas. I've mostly concentrated on GDI (Get data in), which, roughly speaking, covers the ways in which people can get their data into the Splunk Observability Cloud suite. 

### Tutorial: capture traces from a Java application in Kubernetes

Audience: application developers, Kubernetes admins

This tutorial walks users through a process of deploying Splunk's zero configuration auto instrumentation feature (I just call this "zero config") to send data from a sample Java applications to Splunk Observability Cloud. The tutorial specifically shows the process in a Kubernetes environment, as Kubernetes is both relevant and complex.

[Read the tutorial here](https://docs.splunk.com/observability/en/get-started/tutorials/k8s-java-traces-tutorial/about-k8s-java-traces-tutorial.html#about-k8s-java-traces-tutorial).

### Zero config for Kubernetes

Audience: application developers, Kubernetes admins

These docs show users how they can deploy zero config for Java, Node.js, and .NET applications in Kubernetes environments. They're different from the previous tutorial because they cover a broader set of circumstances and they don't use a sample application to demonstrate the process.

See the following links:
* [Java](https://docs.splunk.com/observability/en/gdi/opentelemetry/auto-instrumentation/auto-instrumentation-java-k8s.html)
* [Node.js](https://docs.splunk.com/observability/en/gdi/opentelemetry/auto-instrumentation/auto-instrumentation-nodejs-k8s.html)
* [.NET](https://docs.splunk.com/observability/en/gdi/opentelemetry/auto-instrumentation/auto-instrumentation-dotnet-k8s.html)

### Session tokens API doc

Audience: Splunk admins, site reliability engineers, developers

A brief spec that describes how to use the `POST /v2/password` API endpoint in Splunk Observability Cloud. It covers examples of requests and responses that users might see when using the endpoint.

## Academic work

Throughout my bachelor's degree, I researched and wrote on a variety of topics, mostly in philosophy. I'll upload some of this work in the next update.
