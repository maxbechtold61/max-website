Here is where I keep some of my most important work, both professional and academic.

## Professional work

During my tenure at Splunk, I've written docs for many of our product areas. I've mostly concentrated on GDI (Get data in), which, roughly speaking, covers the ways in which people can get their data into the Splunk Observability Cloud suite. 

### Tutorial: capture traces from a Java application in Kubernetes

Audience: application developers, Kubernetes admins

This tutorial walks users through a process of using Splunk's zero configuration auto instrumentation feature (I just call this "zero config") to send data from their Java applications to Splunk Observability Cloud. The tutorial specifically shows the process in a Kubernetes environment, as Kubernetes is both relevant and complex.

[Read the tutorial here](https://docs.splunk.com/observability/en/get-started/tutorials/k8s-java-traces-tutorial/about-k8s-java-traces-tutorial.html#about-k8s-java-traces-tutorial).

## Academic work

Throughout my bachelor's degree, I researched and wrote on a variety of topics, mostly in philosophy. I'll upload some of this work in the next update.
