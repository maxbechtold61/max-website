    </header>
    <div class="content__body">
        <p>I grew up in Golden Valley (a small suburb in Minnesota), and I currently live in Minneapolis, MN.</p>
<h2 id="my-work">My work</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;ve worked as a technical writer at Splunk, Inc. since July 2023. If you aren&rsquo;t familiar with the profession, a technical writer is essentially someone who writes instructions and tutorials (think about the people who wrote your IKEA guide).</p>
<p>I primarily work on our documentation for the <a href="https://opentelemetry.io/docs/">OpenTelemetry Collector</a>, but I also write docs for our dashboards and detectors, as well as our API.</p>
<h2 id="education">Education</h2>
<p>I studied for my undergrad degree at the University of Minnesota, where I earned a B.A. in Philosophy and a minor in Computer Science. I sometimes refer to this minor as an &ldquo;almost degree&rdquo; in computer science.</p>
<p>My academic interests include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Logic and philosophy of math</li>
<li>Epistemology (especially Bayesian epistemology)</li>
<li>Foundations of mathematics</li>
<li>Speech and rhetoric</li>
<li>Writing consultancy and writing education</li>
</ul>
<p>I graduated class of 2023 with high distinction, which is the <em>summa cum laude</em> for students who didn&rsquo;t do honors.</p>
<h2 id="hobbies-and-interests">Hobbies and interests</h2>
<p>In my free time, I enjoy playing Dungeons and Dragons and similar TTRPGs. I also play a lot of video games &ndash; my favorite series is Dark Souls.</p>
<p>When I&rsquo;m not playing games of some sort, I like studying random topics in math, computer science, philosophy, and science. Currently, I&rsquo;m making my way through a real analysis book, and I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ll finish it anytime soon.</p>
<p>Finally, I like watching basketball, football, and occasionally soccer. Cheering for the Minnesota Vikings tends to make me miserable, so I often need to take breaks from sports.</p>
