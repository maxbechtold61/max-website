      <description>I grew up in Golden Valley (a small suburb in Minnesota), and I currently live in Minneapolis, MN.&#xA;My work I&amp;rsquo;ve worked as a technical writer at Splunk, Inc. since July 2023. If you aren&amp;rsquo;t familiar with the profession, a technical writer is essentially someone who writes instructions and tutorials (think about the people who wrote your IKEA guide).&#xA;I primarily work on our documentation for the OpenTelemetry Collector, but I also write docs for our dashboards and detectors, as well as our API.</description>
