      <description>My name is Maximilian Bechtold. I&amp;rsquo;m a technical writer by day, but I moonlight as a quack philosopher, computer scientist, and mathematician. I grew up in St. Louis Park (a small suburb in Minnesota), and I currently live in Minneapolis, MN.&#xA;My career I&amp;rsquo;ve worked as a technical writer at Splunk, Inc. since July 2023. If you aren&amp;rsquo;t familiar with the profession, a technical writer is essentially someone who writes instructions and tutorials (think about the people who wrote your IKEA guide).</description>
